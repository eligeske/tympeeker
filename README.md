A time picker on a great start! Want to help?

This time picker looks simple, but right now is extremely bloated with code and css. The idea is there, needs some refactoring.

Grab the code, simplify and share.

Todo
---------
* Simplify HTML/CSS, perhaps all javascript generated
* Make sure the selector boxes don't open up off screen
* Refactor JavaScript to remove bloat
* Create as jQuery plugin on input element
* Use height/width/font-size of target element to style
